This site showcases data science projects I've worked on in my free time. At the moment, they
are broken down into machine learning projects and full end-to-end projects presented as iPython Notebooks.


## Data Wrangling and Visualization
- [MyFitbit](https://github.com/curtishiga/MyFitBit): (*In Progress*) As someone who has suffered from chronic migraines and even been diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea, this project takes data from my personal Fitbit to here investigate my sleep patterns.

## Machine Learning
- [Predict Future Sales](https://github.com/curtishiga/Predict_Fututre_Sales): Using 2.5 years worth of data, 
a random forest, XGBoost, and a recurrent neural network were developed to predict how many items each shop will 
sell in the following month. 

- [Pet Adoption Prediction](https://github.com/curtishiga/PetFinder_Adopt_Prediction): Given descriptions of rescued pets
along with image and sentiment analysis based on inputs given by the rescuer, multiple models were produced to predict how
long it'll take for a pet to be adopted.


## End-to-End Projects
- [Bay Area Housing](https://github.com/curtishiga/Capstone_Project1): ARIMA models were created to predict the 
trend of Bay Area housing by county. Data was taken from the Zillow API and the models were trained on data from 
January 2010 to April 2018.

- [MLB Pitching](https://github.com/curtishiga/Capstone_Project2): Using pitching data from the MLB 2015-2017 regular 
seasons, numerous neural networks were designed to predict the outcome of a pitch.
