This site showcases data science projects I've worked on in my free time. At the moment, they
are broken down into machine learning projects and full end-to-end projects presented as iPython Notebooks.


# Data Wrangling and Visualization
- [MyFitbit](https://github.com/curtishiga/MyFitBit): (*In Progress*) As someone who has suffered from chronic migraines and even been diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea, this project takes data from my personal Fitbit to here investigate my sleep patterns.

# Machine Learning
- [Predict Future Sales](https://github.com/curtishiga/Predict_Fututre_Sales): Using 2.5 years worth of data, 
a random forest, XGBoost, and a recurrent neural network were developed to predict how many items each shop will 
sell in the following month. 

- [Pet Adoption Prediction](https://github.com/curtishiga/PetFinder_Adopt_Prediction): Given descriptions of rescued pets
along with image and sentiment analysis based on inputs given by the rescuer, multiple models were produced to predict how
long it'll take for a pet to be adopted.


# End-to-End Projects
- [Bay Area Housing](https://github.com/curtishiga/Capstone_Project1): ARIMA models were created to predict the 
trend of Bay Area housing by county. Data was taken from the Zillow API and the models were trained on data from 
January 2010 to April 2018.

- [MLB Pitching](https://github.com/curtishiga/Capstone_Project2): Using pitching data from the MLB 2015-2017 regular 
seasons, numerous neural networks were designed to predict the outcome of a pitch.


# Springboard Data Science Career Track

## [API_Mini_Project](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/API_Mini_Project)
- This folder contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the ability to pull data from an API and wrangle it for data analysis

## [EDA_hospital_readmit](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/EDA_hospital_readmit)
  - This project demonstrates the ability to recognize and construct statistical data analysis on hospital readmission data

## [EDA_human_temperature](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/EDA_human_temperature)
  - In this project, statistical data analysis was performed on a human body temperature data set which demonstrates the ability to conduct hypothesis testing and determining statistical significance.
  
## [EDA_racial_discrimination](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/EDA_racial_discrimination)
  - This mini project does some exploratory data analysis to see whether race plays a significant role in callback rates for resumes.
  
## [JSON_Data_Wrangling](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/JSON_Data_Wrangling)
  - The purpose of this project is to demonstrate familiarity with packages dealing with JSON and data wrangling techniques in Python
  
## [ML_Linear_Regression](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/ML_Linear_Regression)
  - This mini project demonstrates the ability to utilize the sklearn packages and apply a linear regression model on Boston housing data
  
## [ML_Logistic_Regression](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/ML_Logistic_Regression)
  - The purpose of this assignment is to develop a logistic regression model to predict someone's gender based on weight and height.
  
## [ML_Naive_Bayes](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/ML_Naive_Bayes)
  - This project demonstrates the ability to create and fit a Naive Bayes model.
  
## [ML_Unsupervised](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/ML_Unsupervised)
  - This assignment establishes knowledge of unsupervised machine learning and how to develop a model.
  
## [Relax_Challenge](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/Relax_Challenge)
  - This is a practice take-home challenge meant to walk through the data science process and determine which factors are important to the clients problem.
  
## [SQL_Practice](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/SQL_Practice)
  - The purpose behind this mini project was to practice writing SQL queries to pull data from multiple tables
  
## [Ultimate_Challenge](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Data_Science_Career_Track/tree/master/Ultimate_Challenge)
  - In this practice take-home challenge, a client wanted to figure out what factors are most important in determining user retention. The goal was to explore the data and develop a model to answer the clients problem.
